### MVC Skeleton

This is an MVC skeleton which can be adapted to quickly set up an MVC for any application.

Currently, as it stands, the program allows users to register, login, and submit informationn to Sqlite3 via the ORM.

Note: The wrapper is not currently passing any data from the API to the app. It has been included to allow for quick deployment in the future.

Second Note: There is an Admin functionality. Disable if you don't need it.
